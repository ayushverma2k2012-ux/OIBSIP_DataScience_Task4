# Email Spam Detection ‚Äî Machine Learning Project

## üìò Objective
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate a **machine learning-based spam email classifier** that can automatically detect whether an email is *spam* or *non-spam (ham)*.  
Using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model analyzes email text data and learns patterns commonly found in spam messages such as phishing attempts, promotions, or scam content.

## üß© Steps Performed

### 1. *Data Loading*
- Imported the **Email Spam dataset** (from the provided source or CSV file).  
- Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for inspection.  
- Checked the data for missing or duplicate entries and verified label distribution between spam and non-spam emails.

### 2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
- Analyzed the frequency of spam vs ham messages.  
- Visualized the dataset using *count plots* and *word clouds* to identify the most common words in spam and ham emails.  
- Calculated message length statistics to understand text patterns across classes.

### 3. *Data Preprocessing*
- Cleaned and normalized email text by:
  - Removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords.  
  - Converting all text to lowercase.  
  - Applying *tokenization* and *lemmatization* for text standardization.
- Converted text into numerical vectors using *TF-IDF Vectorizer* or *CountVectorizer*.  
- Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.

### 4. *Model Training*
- Implemented multiple classification algorithms for spam detection:
  - *Multinomial Naive Bayes*  
  - *Logistic Regression*  
  - *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*  
- Trained models on vectorized text data and optimized performance using cross-validation.

### 5. *Model Evaluation*
- Evaluated each model using the following metrics:
  - *Accuracy*  
  - *Precision*  
  - *Recall*  
  - *F1 Score*  
- Displayed confusion matrices and classification reports for performance comparison.  
- Identified the best-performing model for classifying spam emails.
